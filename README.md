## UI
I'll have to admit that UI really wasn't a priority on this project, but I'll gladly accept any help provided. There's really no limit to how far you can go. If you need help translating the app into a library for your own UI, I'll assist.

Open an [issue](https://github.com/Techial/FilterBox/issues/new) and ping me @Techial :)

## Support
Open an issue if you feel like anything needs to be added. I'll gladly review pull requests and merge them if deemed to be useful!
